# Bootstrap 5 Dynamic Themes (BTDT)

A professional, real-time theme customizer and modular engine for Bootstrap 5. An alternative to **Bootswatch**.

[**🚀 Live Demo & Visual Designer**](https://franbarinstance.github.io/bootstrap-dynamic-themes/btdt/editor/)

**This is a production-ready theme system.** Use the included visual designer to create your look, and drop the self-contained module into your project.

## Project Structure

This project is organized as a standalone module (`btdt/`) that can be easily dropped into any project.

## Workflow: Design to Production

1.  **Open the Editor**: Launch `btdt/editor/index.html` in your browser (or use the [Live Demo](https://franbarinstance.github.io/bootstrap-dynamic-themes/btdt/editor/)).
2.  **Design**: Use the panel to experiment with 50+ palettes, 50+ fonts, 50+ presets and multiple structural styles.
3.  **Export**: Click **"Copy CSS Preset"** to get your `@import` code.
4.  **Save & Link**: Save your design in `btdt/themes/preset/my-theme.css` and link it in your HTML.

### Editor Bundled Export

The visual editor also includes a browser-side helper at [`btdt/js/minify.js`](btdt/js/minify.js) for generating a **single bundled and minified preset CSS** from the current configuration.

It is designed to mirror the preset flow from [`btdt/scripts/minify/minify.py`](btdt/scripts/minify/minify.py):

- Resolves local `@import` rules recursively
- Leaves external or media-qualified `@import` rules untouched
- Hoists remaining `@import` rules to the top
- Minifies the final combined stylesheet

This feature is only available when the editor is served over `http://` or `https://`, because it relies on `fetch()` to read the imported CSS files. When the editor is opened via `file://`, the bundled export UI is disabled and shows a "not available on file://" message.

## BTDT vs. Bootswatch

While **Bootswatch** is an industry standard for static themes, **BTDT** takes it to the next level by being a dynamic engine:

- **100% Editable**: Don't just pick a theme; design it. Tweak every variable (colors, fonts, borders, rounding) in real-time.
- **Dynamic Runtime**: Change the entire look and feel or toggle dark mode on-the-fly via the Javascript API without a page reload.
- **Modular Design**: Mix and match components. Use the palette from one theme and the typography from another.
- **Custom Presets**: Create and save your own theme combinations using the preset system, making your designs reusable and easy to share.
- **No Compilation Required**: Unlike standard Bootstrap customization, you don't need SCSS, Ruby, or Node modules to tweak your look. Just standard CSS.
- **AI-Ready**: Extend the library easily using an AI assistant (see below).

## How it Works

The application uses a **Modular CSS Injection** strategy managed by the `ThemeManager` class.

1.  **Namespaced Engine**: Everything lives inside the `btdt/` folder to avoid filename collisions (like `js/` or `css/`) in your project.
2.  **Base Path Awareness**: The `ThemeManager` supports a `basePath` configuration, allowing it to find its theme modules regardless of where your HTML file is located.
3.  **Zero-CORS Metadata**: Presets include invisible CSS variables that the engine reads via computed styles, enabling full editor sync even in local environments (`file://`).

### Theme Personalities

BTDT can also apply **theme personalities**: final finish layers that add a distinctive character to a theme without fundamentally changing its identity.

In practice, a personality is not a new palette or a new typography system. It is a surface treatment applied on top of the current theme, usually through contour, shadow, texture, glow, filter, or other finish effects.

Current examples include:

- `none`: no additional finish layer
- `sketch`: irregular contours and rough-draft energy
- `asymmetric`: a more off-balance contour treatment that gives components a distinctive silhouette

The idea is simple: the theme defines what the interface is, and the personality defines how that same interface feels at the final visual layer.

## Pure CSS - No Compilation

Unlike many Bootstrap customization workflows that require complex SCSS/SASS setups, BTDT is built on **Pure CSS** using modern CSS custom properties (variables).

### Advantages:
- **Zero Build Steps**: No `npm install`, no Webpack, no Vite, and no precompilation required. Edit a CSS file and see the result instantly.
- **Runtime Hot-Swapping**: Change the entire look and feel of your app at runtime without reloading or rebuilding.
- **Portability**: The entire module works perfectly even when opened directly from the file system (`file:///`), making it ideal for prototyping.
- **Zero Learning Curve**: You don't need to know CSS or SASS. Use the visual customizer to design your theme and simply copy-paste the code.
- **Lightweight**: Zero toolchain overhead. You only ship the CSS you actually use.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project includes a set of **AI Skills** located in `.agent/skills/`. These allow an AI assistant to extend the project while maintaining professional standards.

You can ask your AI assistant to:
- **Create a new color theme**: "Create a premium dark theme inspired by Cyberpunk visuals."
- **Add new fonts**: "Integrate the 'Montserrat' font from Google Fonts."
- **Design structural styles**: "Create a style module with extra large shadows and glassmorphism."
- **Compose presets**: "Create a 'Minimalist' preset using the Inter font and White palette."

The AI will follow the established architecture, ensuring link legibility and Zero-CORS metadata compatibility.

## Implementation in Production

### 1. Integration
Copy the `btdt/` folder to your project root.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Production Safety**: Add `btdt/editor/` to your `.gitignore` to keep the customizer out of your public environment.

### 2. Choose Implementation Method

#### Option A: Native CSS (Maximum Performance)
Best for static sites where speed is the only priority. Zero JS dependency for initial load.

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link id="theme-preset" rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/preset/studio.min.css">
    <link id="theme-preset-dark" rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/modes/dark.min.css" media="not all">
</head>

<body>
    ...
    <!-- API access -->
    <script src="btdt/js/btdt.min.js?v=x.x.x"></script>
</body>
```

This loads the initial preset directly from HTML using the production-ready minified assets. `btdt.js` does not need to load anything on startup in this setup. It only exposes the API so you can switch presets later if needed.

If you need to debug with source CSS, you can still point the preset `<link>` to a non-minified file manually:

```html
<link id="theme-preset" rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/preset/studio.css">
```

#### Option B: All-in-One Loader (Saves a step)
The simplest way. One single line in the `<head>` handles both CSS injection and API initialization.

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <script data-preset="studio" src="btdt/js/btdt.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Using the JS loader (**Option B**) may cause a slight flash of unstyled content (FOUC) during page load as the CSS is injected via JavaScript. For a perfectly smooth experience, use **Option A**.

For production, prefer `btdt.min.js`. Adding a version to the script URL, for example `btdt/js/btdt.min.js?v=x.x.x`, is a simple way to invalidate browser cache after publishing changes.

The BTDT loader (`btdt.js` / `btdt.min.js`) is **CSP compliant**: it does not require inline styles, `eval`, or a nonce. Named preset loads use `*.min.css` by default; set `data-minified="false"` only if you intentionally want source CSS files.

### About `theme-preset`

When using the JS loader, BTDT manages the active preset through a standard stylesheet tag:

```html
<link id="theme-preset" rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/preset/studio.min.css">
```

This `id` is the fixed hook used by `btdt.js` to detect, reuse, or replace the current preset stylesheet. If it already exists, `btdt.load('aurora')` updates that same `<link>` instead of creating duplicates. If it does not exist, `btdt.js` creates it automatically.

For dark mode, the loader also manages a separate `<link id="theme-preset-dark">` pointing to `btdt/themes/modes/dark.min.css`, enabling it through the `media` attribute when needed.

Supported forms:

```html
<link id="theme-preset" rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/preset/studio.min.css">
<link id="theme-preset" rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/preset/studio.min.css?v=x.x.x">
<link id="theme-preset" rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/preset/studio.css">
```

If you want full manual control, you can disable automatic initialization and keep the initial preset entirely in HTML:

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link id="theme-preset" rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/preset/studio.min.css">
    <script data-auto-init="false" src="btdt/js/btdt.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

In that configuration, `btdt.js` does not load any preset on startup. It only becomes available for later calls such as `btdt.load(...)`.

### 3. API Usage

Regardless of the option chosen (unless you skipped JS), you can use the global `btdt` object:

```javascript
btdt.load('aurora'); // Switch preset dynamically
btdt.toggleMode();   // Toggle Dark/Light mode
```

Available methods:

- `btdt.load(name)`
Loads a preset stylesheet dynamically. You can pass a preset name such as `studio` or `aurora`, or a direct CSS path.

```javascript
btdt.load('studio');
btdt.load('aurora');
btdt.load('aurora', { minified: false });
btdt.load('/assets/themes/custom-theme.css');
btdt.load('/assets/themes/custom-theme.min.css');
```

By default, `btdt.load(name)` uses `*.min.css` for preset names. If you need to override that behavior per call, use:

```javascript
btdt.load('aurora', { minified: false });
```

Common loading patterns:

- Load a named preset:

```javascript
btdt.load('studio'); // -> btdt/themes/preset/studio.min.css
```

- Load a named non-minified preset:

```javascript
btdt.load('studio', { minified: false }); // -> btdt/themes/preset/studio.css
```

- Load by direct path:

```javascript
btdt.load('btdt/themes/preset/studio.css');
btdt.load('btdt/themes/preset/studio.min.css');
```

- Use `data-minified="false"` to switch later named preset loads back to source CSS:

```html
<script data-minified="false" src="btdt/js/btdt.min.js"></script>
```

```javascript
btdt.load('studio'); // -> btdt/themes/preset/studio.css
```

`data-minified="false"` does not load any preset by itself. It only changes the default target used later by `btdt.load(name)`.

If you only want to expose the API and decide later what to load, this is enough:

```html
<script src="btdt/js/btdt.min.js"></script>
```

- `btdt.setMode(mode)`
Sets the active mode explicitly. Accepted values are `light` and `dark`.

```javascript
btdt.setMode('dark');
btdt.setMode('light');
```

- `btdt.toggleMode()`
Switches between `light` and `dark`.

```javascript
btdt.toggleMode();
```

- `btdt.getMode()`
Returns the current mode as a string: `light` or `dark`.

```javascript
const mode = btdt.getMode();
```

Notes:

- `btdt.js` is a production loader. It only handles preset loading and dark/light mode.
- It does not depend on the editor or on `theme-manager.js`.
- It does not need to know which presets exist in advance. It simply updates the active preset stylesheet.
- Full loader documentation, attributes, dark-mode behavior and detailed examples: [btdt/docs/btdt.md](btdt/docs/btdt.md).

## Manual Modular Customization

BTDT is designed to be fully modular. While using the [Visual Designer](https://franbarinstance.github.io/bootstrap-dynamic-themes/btdt/editor/) is the recommended way to create a consistent look, you can also mix and match individual modules manually in your HTML.

This is useful for quick experiments or when you only want to change one specific aspect (like the font) without importing or generating a full preset.

### Example: Changing only the Font
Link the desired font module after the base Bootstrap CSS:

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/fonts/quicksand.min.css">
</head>
```

### Example: Changing only the Color Palette
Link the color module after the base Bootstrap CSS:

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/colors/slate.min.css">
</head>
```

### Mixing Modules
You can combine multiple modules (colors, fonts, styles) to create your own theme directly in HTML:

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/css/bootstrap.min.css">

    <!-- Custom modular mix -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/fonts/inter.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/colors/amber.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="btdt/themes/styles/personality-asymmetric.css">
</head>
```

You can find all available modules in the `btdt/themes/` subdirectories. There are over 50+ color palettes and 100+ typography modules ready to use.

## Dynamic Contrast & Theming

A common challenge in Bootstrap 5+ is handling accessibility and contrast dynamically without bloating the HTML with `data-bs-theme` attributes.

### The Standard (Static) Approach
In standard Bootstrap (and static themes like Bootswatch), developers must explicitly define the contrast mode for each container. If you have a dark background, you add `data-bs-theme="dark"` (or old-school `navbar-dark`) to make the child elements (text, links, buttons) visible.

```html
<!-- You must know IN ADVANCE that bg-primary is dark -->
<header class="bg-primary" data-bs-theme="dark">
    <a class="nav-link" href="#">Static Link</a>
</header>
```
**The limitation**: This approach is hardcoded into your HTML. If you change your theme to a light version at runtime, the `data-bs-theme="dark"` attribute will remain, making the text unreadable (white text on a light background).

### The BTDT (Dynamic) Approach
BTDT handles contrast at the **CSS variable level**. Each theme module calculates its own contrast colors (`--bs-primary-contrast`, etc.), and the engine applies them automatically to components inside background utilities.

```html
<!-- Clean, Agnostic HTML -->
<header class="bg-primary">
    <a class="nav-link" href="#">Automatic Dynamic Link</a>
</header>
```
In some cases you may need to use `text-reset`.

```html
<!-- Clean, Agnostic HTML -->
<a class="nav-link text-reset" href="#">Automatic Dynamic Link</a>
```

- **Zero HTML Changes**: Switch from a dark professional theme to a light pastel style, and your menus, cards, and links **automatically adapt** their colors instantly.
- **Smart Icons**: The navbar toggler and other SVG icons automatically flip their filters to remain visible.
- **Harmonized Accents**: Themes include a synchronized `--accent-color` (automatically derived from your primary color) for decorative elements, ensuring a premium, integrated look across all 50+ palettes.
